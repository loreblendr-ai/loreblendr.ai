# Importing Character Cards

Quickly get your character cards (v1, v2, or v3) into LoreBlendr.AI! We support both JSON and PNG formats.

The import feature is located in the app's **Settings** view.

## Importing PNG Character Cards (Especially for iOS users)

iOS can be a bit tricky with PNG character cards because apps like Photos or copy/pasting can remove the character data embedded in the image.

**Hereâ€™s the fast way to do it on iOS:**

1.  **Option 1: Download to Files & Import**
    *   Download the PNG character card to your iPhone/iPad's **Files app**.
    *   Open LoreBlendr.AI, go to Settings, and use the import option to select the PNG from your Files app.

2.  **Option 2: Use the iOS Share Sheet**
    *   When you have the PNG character card (e.g., in Safari, or another app that handles it correctly), tap the **Share** button.
    *   Look for **LoreBlendr.AI** in the list of apps and select it. The app will then import the card.

**Important for PNGs:**
*   **Do NOT** try to import from your Photos app directly if you saved it there from a source that might strip data.
*   **Do NOT** copy and paste the PNG image itself, as this usually doesn't carry over the character data on iOS.

## Importing JSON Character Cards

This is straightforward:

1.  Copy the entire JSON text of your character card to your clipboard.
2.  Open LoreBlendr.AI, go to Settings, and use the import option. The app should detect the JSON on your clipboard, or you can paste it in.

That's it! You should now have your character ready to chat.
