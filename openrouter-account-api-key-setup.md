# OpenRouter Account & API Key Setup

This guide explains how to set up an OpenRouter account and generate an API key for use with LLM Power Tools.

## 1. Create an OpenRouter Account

First, you'll need an OpenRouter account.

1.  Go to the [OpenRouter sign-up page](https://accounts.openrouter.ai/sign-up).
2.  You can sign up using your email address or a Google account.

## 2. Create an API Key

Once your account is created, you can generate an API key.

1.  Navigate to the [API Keys page](https://openrouter.ai/settings/keys) in your OpenRouter settings.
2.  Click the **Create Key** button.
3.  Give your key a descriptive name (e.g., "LLM Power Tools Key").
4.  You can set an optional credit limit to control costs. For free models, a limit of `$0` is fine.
5.  Click **Create**.
6.  **Important:** Copy your new API key immediately and store it in a safe place. You will not be able to see it again.

## 3. Using the Key in LLM Power Tools

1.  Open LLM Power Tools and go to the **Settings** tab.
2.  Paste your API key into the "OpenRouter API Key" field.
3.  The key is stored securely in your device's private keychain.
